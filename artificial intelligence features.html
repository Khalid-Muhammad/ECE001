      <h3>
        1. Eliminate Dull and Boring Tasks </h3>

      All of us have, at some point, accomplished a certain task just because we had
      to do it, not because we enjoyed doing it. We found that task to be boring,
      or dull. However, with a machine, you never have to experience similar boredness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3> 2. Data Ingestion </h3>

      Data ingestion is one of the most important features of artificial intelligence.
      Artificially intelligent systems deal with huge amounts of data. Even a small
      company of about 50 employees has huge chunks of data to analyze, we can’t
      even imagine the quantity of data that organizations like Facebook handle.
      Also, an artificially intelligent system stores multiple information about
      multiple entities from multiple sources. All of this appears on the system
      in a synchronous, or a simultaneous manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3> 3. Imitates Human Cognition </h3>
      We call it an artificially intelligent system because it essentially imitates or
      mimics the way the human mind thinks and solves problems. This is what makes
      AI unique. Like the humans study their environment, draw inferences, and
      then interact with it accordingly, an AI also successfully attempts to interpret
      the environment and act suitably. However it is not entirely possible, as
      of today, but developers and scientists are working on systems that cater
      to the theory of mind and self-awareness of the artificially intelligent
      systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3> 4. Futuristic </h3>
      AI-enabled systems are designed to observe and react to their surroundings. They
      not only perceive the environment and take actions accordingly but also keep
      in mind (isn’t it ironic that I just used ‘mind’ for artificial intelligence?)
      the situations that might come up in the near future. The classic example
      of this characteristic would be a self-driven car. It notes the speed of
      the cars that are driving around and tries implementing similar speed patterns
      in the traffic, also known as neural networks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3> 5. Prevent Natural Disasters </h3>
      We are all friendly with using AI for our businesses, for our gaming profiles,
      and more such purposes. Now it is our turn to take AI one step ahead and
      hone it, so that governments can use it in disaster management. Artificially
      intelligent systems, when fed with data about thousands of previous disasters,
      AI can accurately predict the future relating to the disasters that might
      occur.
    </p>

      <h3> 6. Facial Recognition and Chatbots </h3>
      Facial recognition system enables a machine to unlock or provide authorized access
      to an individual, by verifying or identifying a person’s face. A camera fit
      into the machine senses the face, and it is compared to a previously stored
      face in its memory. Most smartphones these days provide facial recognition
      to unlock the phone.
