    <h1>How Does Artificial Intelligence work </h1>
    <p> Can machines think? — Alan Turing, 1950 Less than a decade after breaking the
      Nazi encryption machine Enigma and helping the Allied Forces win World War
      II, mathematician Alan Turing changed history a second time with a simple
      question: "Can machines think?"  Turing's paper "Computing Machinery and
      Intelligence" (1950), and its subsequent Turing Test, established the fundamental
      goal and vision of artificial intelligence.    At its core, AI is the branch
      of computer science that aims to answer Turing's question in the affirmative.
      It is the endeavor to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machines.
      The expansive goal of artificial intelligence has given rise to many questions
      and debates. So much so, that no singular definition of the field is universally
      accepted.   The major limitation in defining AI as simply "building machines
      that are intelligent" is that it doesn't actually explain what artificial
      intelligence is? What makes a machine intelligent? In their groundbreaking
      textbook Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, authors Stuart Russell
      and Peter Norvig approach the question by unifying their work around the
      theme of intelligent agents in machines. With this in mind, AI is "the study
      of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions."
      (Russel and Norvig viii) Norvig and Russell go on to explore four different
      approaches that have historically defined the field of AI:  Thinking humanly
      Thinking rationally Acting humanly  Acting rationally The first two ideas
      concern thought processes and reasoning, while the others deal with behavior.
      Norvig and Russell focus particularly on rational agents that act to achieve
      the best outcome, noting "all the skills needed for the Turing Test also
      allow an agent to act rationally." (Russel and Norvig 4). Patrick Winston,
      the Ford professor of artificial intelligence and computer science at MIT, defines
      AI as  "algorithms enabled by constraints, exposed by representations that
      support models targeted at loops that tie thinking, perception and action
      together."
