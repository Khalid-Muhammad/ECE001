    <h1> How To Get The Most Out of AI </h1>
    <p> Fast-improving technologies are fascinating but frustrating. When technologies
      progress quickly, executives can feel that they are on a treadmill with the
      carrot always dangling just out of reach. They know they are making an investment
      — they can see the money and effort disappearing — but the benefits can seem
      like they are perpetually “coming soon.” This is particularly true for a
      technology like AI, which lends itself well to flashy demonstrations and
      science fiction. But working in labs and movies is quite different from working
      in production within organizations.

    <p> AI is helping organizations access unstructured information. Finding answers
      would be much easier if all information were structured in neat tables with
      a limited set of defined values for each column, all nicely filled in with
      no missing data. Boyce and Codd would be so happy! But no company exists
      in this highly normalized world. Instead, data isn’t structured because it
      is inherently unstructured or the costs of adding structure are prohibitive.
      For Airbnb listings, some structure is easy — logging a property’s number
      of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage, amenities like a pool,
      etc. The difficulty is that, while these data points help, customers can’t
      narrow down the sheer number of listings to a manageable subset of possibilities
      using just this easily structured data.
